    "In Lab 4, you have practiced with linear classifiers, specifically with logistic regression. In this assignment, you will work on a non-linear classfier: you will build an implementation of a univariate decision tree algorithm that can classify data based on both discrete and numeric variables. The exercise consists of the following parts:\n",
    "1. Introduction: Introduction to a problem that requires a non-linear decision boundary.\n",
    "2. The Dataset: Understand the data to be classified.\n",
    "3. Entropy and Information Gain: Measure the quality of a split in a decision tree.\n",
    "4. Creating Decision Trees: Finish the implementation for discrete trees.\n",
    "5. Adding the Numeric Tree: Finish the implementation for numeric trees.\n",
    "6. Comparing Results: Compare validation results among a discrete, numeric and hybrid tree.\n",
    "7. Analysis: Evaluate the final results.\n",

    "For decision trees we use the information theoretic entropy, also known as Shannon entropy. This tells us something about the amount of information contained in a certain distribution of data.\n",
    "The best split is the split on a feature that separates most of the '1's from the '0's in the resulting two sets. Entropy can thus also be regarded as a measure of purity, and we aim for the purest classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "An entropy close to 1.0 indicates that a certain split leads to (two) subsets of the data that contain an equal number of labels '1' and '0' in each of the two subsets, and thus this split is not useful. In the graph below, the relation between entropy and the proportion of data points belonging to one class (in this case '+') in a data set is plotted. As can be seen in the image, the entropy is maximal when the set contains an equal number of '1' and '0' labels. At this point the uncertainty is the highest. The entropy decreases as the data set becomes 'purer'. Our goal is to decrease the entropy by making proper splits.\n",

Tree type 1 will contain only discrete splits, tree type 2 will contain only numeric splits and tree type 0 will try both and use the split with the highest information gain.
